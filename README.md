# p5js-snake-game

Simple snake game created with p5js

Feautres:
  - Fully working snake with controls (arrow keys or WASD) and growing mechanic when food is eaten
  - Food spawning when there is none
  - Snake does not die when reaching the edges but warps to the other side
  - Pause game with P
  - Game over when snake head meets tail
  - New game screen
  - All screens (Game over, new, pause) include controls
  

ToDo:
  - Different game modes (reaching the edge = defeat?, super-food giving more than one tail?...)
  - Create a score system
  - Implement win conditions and screen
  - Comment the code
  - Differentiate framerate from game speed


Bugs:
  - At certain canvas widths snake warps a tile before the edge
  - ???
